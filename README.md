# ID_Card-with-Scss

## ID Card Page
This is a simple web page showing an example of an ID Card. The page was created with HTML and uses Sass (SCSS) instead of simple CSS for style management.

## Getting Started
To view the page, simply open the index.html file in the browser.

If you want to make changes to the page style, you need to compile the style.scss file in CSS. To do this, you can use a SCSS compiler such as Sass or node-sass.

## Structure of the project
index.html: HTML file that defines the page structure.
style.scss: SCSS file that defines the page style. This file uses variables, mixin and nesting to simplify CSS writing.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- Sass (SCSS)
